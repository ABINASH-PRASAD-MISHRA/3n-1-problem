# 3n-1-problem
The Collatz-conjecture (the famous 3n+1-problem):
 we construct a sequence of integers starting with integer n = a_0
If a_j is even, the next number ist a_(j+1) = a_j/2.
If a_j is odd, the next number ist a_(j+1) = 3*a_j+1.
Example n = 6:
6, 3, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1
 The Collatz-conjecture: the sequence with a every positive starting-integer ends always in the sequence 4,2 1
